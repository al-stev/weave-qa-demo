Part 2 – Evaluation Logger ("a more flexible approach to evaluating AI applications")

Learning Objective:
Demonstrate the EvaluationLogger workflow for real-time evaluation with comprehensive 
scoring across multiple model variants. This showcases W&B's EvaluationLogger as announced
in their product launch.
